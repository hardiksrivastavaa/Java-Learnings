## Introduction to Java

In this section, I started with the basics, learning about the history, features, and versions of Java. I also explored the major components of Java including the JVM, JRE, and JDK.

## Basic Syntax

Here, I learned about the fundamental building blocks of Java:
- **Data Types:** Understanding primitive and non-primitive data types.
- **Variables:** How to declare and use variables.
- **Operators:** Arithmetic, relational, logical, and bitwise operators.

## Control Statements

I dived into decision-making constructs and loop control:
- **Decision Control:** `if-else` statements, `switch` statements.
- **Loop Control:** `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops.

## Methods in Java

This section covered the basics of defining methods, using return types, parameters, and method overloading for versatile function definitions.

## Arrays

I learned about handling collections of data:
- **Single-Dimensional Arrays:** Declaring, initializing, and accessing arrays.
- **Multi-Dimensional Arrays:** Understanding 2D arrays and beyond.
- **Array Manipulations:** Sorting, searching, and more.

## Strings in Java

Here, I explored the powerful String class:
- **String Handling:** Creation and manipulation of strings.
- **String Methods:** Learning about important string methods for manipulation.

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

I took a deep dive into OOP concepts:
- **Classes and Objects:** Basic building blocks of Java.
- **Constructors:** Special methods to initialize objects.
- **Encapsulation:** Bundling data with methods.
- **Inheritance:** Establishing parent-child relationships between classes.
- **Polymorphism:** Using method overloading and overriding.
- **Abstraction:** Hiding implementation details from the user.

## Exception Handling

I explored how to handle errors and exceptions in Java:
- **Types of Exceptions:** Checked vs. unchecked exceptions.
- **Try-Catch Blocks:** Handling exceptions gracefully.
- **Custom Exceptions:** Creating user-defined exceptions.

## Advanced Java Concepts

Moving into more complex areas:
- **Collections Framework:** Learning about List, Set, Map, and their implementations.
- **Multi-threading:** Understanding how to run code concurrently.
- **File Handling:** Reading from and writing to files.
- **Networking:** Basics of network programming in Java.

## Spring and Spring Boot

In this final phase, I will transition to learning about the Spring framework and Spring Boot:
- **Spring Framework:** Introduction to dependency injection, aspect-oriented programming, and Spring modules.
- **Spring Boot:** Quickly building and deploying RESTful services.

### Project: [Project Name]

I will culminate my learning by developing a project using the skills acquired in Spring and Spring Boot.
